Improving your score involves actively engaging with the CELO ecosystem and building a strong, verifiable identity. Here are key strategies:
1. Verify Your Identity
Start by minting the User Verification SBT. This often involves linking your wallet to a verified identity provider or completing KYC (Know Your Customer) steps through Masa.
2. Build Your Credit Score
Engage with CELO-based financial services like micro-loans or DeFi platforms. Repaying loans on time and maintaining healthy wallet activity can improve your Credit Score SBT.
3. Participate in Communities
Join CELO-based DAOs, forums, and projects. Your contributions and interactions can earn you a higher Community Reputation SBT.
4. Claim a .celo Domain
Minting a .celo domain name not only personalizes your Web3 identity but also adds credibility to your profile.
5. Use CELO Wallets
Use wallets like Valora or MiniPay, which support CELOâ€™s native features and integrate with the Prosperity Passport. These wallets often offer tools to manage your SBTs and interact with CELO dApps. [docs.celo.org]
